# dns-delegation-audit
DNS-first audit tool to identify externally delegated subdomains with no observable backend infrastructure. Performs CNAME resolution, TCP/443 and HTTPS reachability checks, and classifies delegation state for infrastructure hygiene and attack surface reduction. Not an exploit or takeover tool.
